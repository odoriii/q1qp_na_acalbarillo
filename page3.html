          <h1> Distributions of Countries in our Data </h1>
          <p> As you can see in our data, we chose 20 countries in <span>Asia </span>, 18 in <span>Europe</span>,
            6 in <span>Africa</span>, 4 in <span>America</span>, 2 in <span>Australia.</span> Just by looking 
            at these datas, you can determine that it is a sample because we did not choose all countries in every continent.
            This page will let you determine which continents in our data are the happiest, what year all of the countries 
            are the happiest, and some discoveries that you will see on the next pages. </p>
